# SapperEdge for the serverless framework
This is a template for your next sapper deployment on AWS.
There is literally nothing similar out there to host Sapper **at the Edge** on AWS,
so I had to take the chance.

## Usage
Just clone this repo and you're good to go. 
Default Sapper commands (`dev`, `export`, `build` and `start`) are included
as well as `deploy` and `local` for testing and deploying over the serverless cli.
Make sure to download and initialize the serverless cli first.

# Have Fun :)
